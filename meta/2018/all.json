All packages are published together in \"lockstep\" with the same version number so the effort to upgrade ServiceStack projects can be done all at same time, with low frequency.\n\nWhilst we want to minimize the effort for Customers to upgrade we also want to make any fixes or enhancements to the previous release available sooner as there are often fixes reported and resolved immediately after each release and made available in our [pre-release packages on MyGet](https://docs.servicestack.net/myget) that most Customers wont get until the next major Release on NuGet.","url":"https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5.0.0#future-versioning-scheme","wordCount":126,"lineCount":9,"group":"v5.0"},{"slug":"feature2","draft":false,"title":"ServiceStack Mobile and Desktop Apps","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/HelloMobile/master/screenshots/splash-900.png","tags":[],"date":"\/Date(1514937600000-0000)\/","content":"The [HelloMobile](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/HelloMobile) project has been rewritten to use the latest v5 .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework clients and contains multiple versions of the same App demonstrating a number of different calling conventions, service integrations and reuse possibilities for each of the following platforms:\n\n- WPF\n- UWP\n- Xamarin.Android\n- Xamarin.iOS\n- Xamarin.OSX\n- Xamarin.Forms\n    - iOS\n    - Android\n    - UWP","url":"https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5.0.0#servicestack-mobile-and-desktop-apps","wordCount":77,"lineCount":17,"group":"v5.0"},{"slug":"feature1","draft":false,"title":"Dart and Flutter!","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/dart/dart.png","tags":[],"date":"\/Date(1524528000000-0000)\/","content":"We're super excited to announce first-class support for [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org) and [Flutter](https://flutter.io)! - Google’s premier new mobile UI framework for crafting high-quality native interfaces for iOS and Android from a single code-base in record time with a Reactive development model simplifying the effort for building Complex UIs in similar vein to development models pioneered in popular JavaScript frameworks like React, React Native, Vue and Angular. It's offers a beautiful blend of rapid development cycles with its built-in Hot Reloading giving you instant iterative feedback of changes to your Mobile App in milliseconds, whilst still offering high-performance native experiences at runtime where Dart code is AOT compiled into native ARM in iOS and Android.","url":"https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5.1.0#dart-and-flutter","wordCount":131,"lineCount":7,"group":"v5.1"},{"slug":"feature1","draft":false,"title":"Spanified ServiceStack","image":"https://servicestack.net/img/logo-text.svg","tags":[],"date":"\/Date(1535414400000-0000)\/","content":"Major rework was performed across the ServiceStack.Text and ServiceStack.Common foundational libraries to replace its internal usage of `StringSegment`\nwith .NET's new high-performance\n[Span and Memory Types](https://www.codemag.com/article/1807051/Introducing-.NET-Core-2.1-Flagship-Types-Span-T-and-Memory-T) primitives\nwhich are now used for all JSON/JSV deserialization and many other String utilities.\n\nThe new `Span<T>` and `ReadOnlyMemory<char>` Types is the successor to `StringSegment` which are both allocation-free, but Span also enjoys additional runtime support as a JIT intrinsic for improved performance.\n\nThis change was primarily an internal refactor so there shouldn't be any user visible differences except for the addition of the\n[System.Memory](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Memory) dependency which contains the new Memory types. As a general rule we're averse to adopting\nnew dependencies but the added performance of these new primitives makes it a required dependency for maintaining high-performance libraries.","url":"https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5.2#spanified-servicestack","wordCount":142,"lineCount":15,"group":"v5.2"},{"slug":"feature1","draft":false,"title":".NET Core Windows Desktop Apps!","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/app/netcore-chromium-splash.png","tags":[],"date":"\/Date(1537315200000-0000)\/","content":"Our new [app](https://www.nuget.org/packages/app) build tool is packed with features for \"Chromitizing\" any\n.NET Core Web App into a **.NET Core Windows Desktop App** that's as easy as installing the `app` tool:\n\n```bash\n$ dotnet tool install -g app\n```\n\nand using it to run your .NET Core Web App's `.dll`, e.g:\n\n```bash\n$ app MyApp.dll\n```\n\nWhere it will run your .NET Core App and host it inside an Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) browser.\n\nThis provides instant utility for being able to deploy .NET Core Apps end users can run locally using Chrome's leading and consistent rendering engine\nwithin a Windows Desktop Application.","url":"https://docs.servicestack.net/releases/v5.4#net-core-windows-desktop-apps","wordCount":116,"lineCount":23,"group":"v5.4"}],"videos":[],"posts":[]}
