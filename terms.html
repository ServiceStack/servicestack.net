<p>This License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and ServiceStack, Inc. and governs your use of the Software (excluding any services which ServiceStack may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and ServiceStack in relation to the Software.</p>
<p>You agree that if ServiceStack, Inc. does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in this License Agreement (or which ServiceStack, Inc. has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of ServiceStack's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to ServiceStack, Inc.</p>
<p>If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of this License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from this License Agreement without affecting the rest of this License Agreement. The remaining provisions of this License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which ServiceStack, Inc. is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to this License Agreement and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of this License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to this License Agreement.</p>
<p>EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SOFTWARE. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.</p>

Neither you nor ServiceStack shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under this License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party shall have the right to assign this Agreement in connection with the merger, reorganization or acquisition of such party or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement, without such consent.</p>
<p>This License Agreement, and your relationship with ServiceStack, Inc. under this License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and ServiceStack, Inc. agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of New Castle County, Delaware to resolve any legal matter arising from this License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that ServiceStack, Inc. shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p>ServiceStack may provide notices to you via email, written or hard copy notice, or through posting on the Software, as determined by ServiceStack, Inc. in our sole discretion. ServiceStack, Inc. reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notice to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notice as described in this Agreement.</p>
<p>We may revise this Agreement from time to time. The most current version will always be on this page. If in our sole discretion the revision is material, we will notify you as provided in this Agreement at least thirty days before the revisions become effective. By continuing to access or use the Software after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Agreement.</p>
