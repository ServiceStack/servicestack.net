[Ollama](https://ollama.com), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) and [Jan](https://jan.ai) 
have become popular choices for AI enthusiasts looking to run large language models 
(LLMs) locally which provide a UX-friendly intuitive interfaces for downloading, installing and running 
a variety of open-source models on personal workstations, acceleratable with GPUs.

But when the time comes to move beyond experimentation to hosting these models in a production environment, 
a different solution often proves more effective: llama.cpp's llama-server.

While Ollama and LM Studio excel at creating accessible local AI experiences, llama-server offers 
the performance, flexibility, and scalability needed for production deployment scenarios. 
Let's explore why this less-known option might be your best bet when transitioning from playing with 
LLMs to properly hosting them
