[llms.py](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms) is a lightweight OSS CLI, API and ChatGPT-like alternative to Open WebUI 
for accessing multiple LLMs that still only requires 1 (aiohttp) dependency, entirely offline, with all data kept private in browser storage.

## v2.0.24

### Metrics and Analytics

We're happy to announce the next major release of **llms.py v2.0.24** now includes API pricing for all premium LLMs,
observability with detailed usage and metric insights, so you're better able to analyze and track your 
spend within the UI.

#### Metrics everywhere

- **Cost per Model** - Model selector now displays the Input and Output cost per 1M token for every premium model.
- **Thread-Level Cost & Token Metrics** - Total cost and token count for every conversation thread, displayed in your history sidebar.
- **Per-Message Token Breakdown** - Each individual message, both from you and the AI, now clearly shows its token count.
- **Thread Summaries** - At the bottom of every new conversation, you'll find a consolidated summary detailing the total cost, tokens consumed (input and output), number of requests, and overall response time for that entire thread.

Screenshot also shows support for new **Edit** and **Redo** features that appears after hovering over any **User** 
message, to modify or re-run an existing prompt.

### Dark Mode

Support for Dark Mode which inherits the browser's dark mode preference or can be toggled
with the **Dark Mode toggle** in the top-right of the UI.

### Monthly Cost Analytics

The **Cost Analytics** page provides a comprehensive overview of the usage costs for every day within a given month.
Clicking on a day will expand it to show a detailed breakdown of the costs that was spent per model and provider.

### Monthly Tokens Analytics

Similarly, the **Tokens Analytics** page provides a comprehensive overview of the token usage for every day within a 
given month. Clicking on a day expands it to show a detailed breakdown of the tokens that was spent per model and provider.

### Monthly Activity Log

The **Activity Log** page lets you view the individual requests that make up the daily cost and token usage,
the page itself provides a comprehensive and granular overview of all your AI interactions and requests including:
Model, Provider, Partial Prompt, Input & Output Tokens, Cost, Response Time, Speed, Date & Time.

:::{.wideshot}
[![analytics-activity.webp](/img/posts/ai-chat/analytics-activity.webp)](/img/posts/ai-chat/analytics-activity.webp)
:::

Activity Logs are maintained independently of the Chat History so you can clear or cleanup your Chat History
without losing the detailed Activity Logs of your AI requests. Likewise you can delete Activity Logs
without losing your Chat History.

### Check Providers

Another feature added in this release is the ability to check the status of configured providers to test if they're 
configured correctly, reachable and what their response times is for the simplest `1+1=` request:

Check all models for a provider:

:::sh
llms --check groq
:::

Check specific models for a provider:

:::sh
llms --check groq kimi-k2 llama4:400b gpt-oss:120b
:::

:::{.wideshot}
[![llms-check.webp](/img/posts/ai-chat/llms-check.webp)](/img/posts/ai-chat/llms-check.webp)
:::

As they're a good indicator for the reliability and speed you can expect from different providers we've created a 
[test-providers.yml](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms/actions/workflows/test-providers.yml) GitHub Action to
test the response times for all configured providers and models, the results of which will be frequently published to
[/checks/latest.txt](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms/blob/main/docs/checks/latest.txt)

## ChatGPT, but Local 🎯

In keeping with the simplicity goals of [llms.py](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms), its [/ui](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms/tree/main/llms/ui) 
is small and fast by following the 
[Simple Modern JavaScript](https://servicestack.net/posts/javascript) approach of leveraging JS Modules support 
in Browsers to avoid needing any npm dependencies or build tools.

### Offline, Fast and Private

OSS & Free, no sign ups, no ads, no tracking, etc. All data is stored locally in the browser's IndexedDB that can
be exported and imported to transfer chat histories between different browsers.

A goal for **llms.py** is to only require a single python **aiohttp** dependency for minimal risk of conflicts within 
multiple Python Environments, e.g. it's an easy drop-in inside a ComfyUI Custom Node as it doesn't require any 
additional deps.

## Install

:::sh
pip install llms-py
:::

Start the UI and an OpenAI compatible API on port **8000**:

:::sh
llms --serve 8000
:::

To launch the UI at `http://localhost:8000` and an OpenAI Endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions`.

## Simple and Flexible UI

This starts the Chat UI from where you can interact with any of your configured OpenAI-compatible Chat 
Providers - for a single unified interface for accessing both local and premium cloud LLMs from the same UI.

## Configuration

You can configure which OpenAI compatible providers and models you want to use by adding them to your 
[llms.json](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms/blob/main/llms/llms.json) in `~/.llms/llms.json`

Whilst the [ui.json](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms/blob/main/llms/ui.json) configuration for the UI is maintained 
in `~/.llms/ui.json` where you can configure your preferred system prompts and other defaults.

### Import / Export

All data is stored locally in the browser's IndexedDB which as it is tied to the browser's origin, you'll be 
able to maintain multiple independent conversational databases by just running the server on a different port.

When needed you can backup and transfer your entire chat history between different browsers using the **Export** 
and **Import** features on the home page.

:::

**Export Request Logs**

You can also export your request log history (used by Analytics) by holding down `ALT` while clicking the **Export** button, 
which can also be imported with **Import**. 


## Rich Markdown & Syntax Highlighting

To maximize readability there's full support for Markdown and Syntax highlighting for the most popular programming 
languages.

[![llms-syntax.webp](/img/posts/ai-chat/llms-syntax.webp)](/img/posts/ai-chat/llms-syntax.webp)
:::

To quickly and easily make use of AI Responses, **Copy Code** icons are readily available on hover of all messages
and code blocks.

## Rich, Multimodal Inputs

The Chat UI goes beyond just text and can take advantage of the multimodal capabilities of modern LLMs
with support for Image, Audio and File inputs.

### 🖼️ 1. Image Inputs & Analysis

Images can be uploaded directly into your conversations with vision-capable models for comprehensive image analysis.

Visual AI Responses are highly dependent on the model used. This is a typical example of the visual analysis provided by the latest Gemini Flash of our [ServiceStack Logo](/img/logo.png):

### 🎤 2. Audio Input & Transcription

Likewise you can upload Audio files and have them transcribed and analyzed by multi-modal models with audio capabilities.

:::{.wideshot}
[![attach-audio.webp](/img/posts/ai-chat/attach-audio.webp)](/img/posts/ai-chat/attach-audio.webp)
:::

Example of processing audio input. Audio files can be uploaded with system and user prompts
to instruct the model to transcribe and summarize its content where its 
multi-modal capabilities are integrated right within the chat interface.

### 📎 3. File and PDF Attachments

In addition to images and audio, you can also upload documents, PDFs and other files to
capable models to extract insights, summarize content or analyze data.

**Document Processing Use Cases:**
- **PDF Analysis**: Upload PDF documents for content extraction and analysis
- **Data Extraction**: Extract specific information from structured documents
- **Document Summarization**: Get concise summaries of lengthy documents
- **Query Content**: Ask questions about specific content in documents
- **Batch Processing**: Upload multiple files for comparative analysis

Perfect for research, document review, data analysis and content extractions.

their AI requests with advanced options including:

 - **Temperature** `(0-2)` for controlling response randomness 
 - **Max Completion Tokens** to limit response length
 - **Seed** values for deterministic sampling 
 - **Top P** `(0-1)` for nucleus sampling
 - **Frequency** & **Presence Penalty** `(-2.0 to 2.0)` for reducing repetition

## Enable / Disable Providers

Dynamically manage which providers you want to enable and disable at runtime.
Providers are invoked in the order they're defined in `llms.json` that supports the requested model.
If a provider fails, it tries the next available provider.

By default Providers with Free tiers are enabled first, followed by local providers and then premium
cloud providers which can all be enabled or disabled in the UI:

## Smart Autocomplete for Models & System Prompts

Autocomplete components are used to quickly find and select the preferred model and system prompt.

Only models from enabled providers will appear in the drop down, which will be available immediately after
providers are enabled.
