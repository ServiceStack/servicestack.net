# ChatGPT, but Local üéØ

Simple ChatGPT-like UI to access ALL Your LLMs, Locally or Remotely!

In keeping with the simplicity and goals of [llms.py](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms) the new UI still only 
requires its single **aiohttp** python dependency for all client and server features. 

The [/ui](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms/tree/main/ui) is small, fast and lightweight and follows the 
[Simple Modern JavaScript](https://servicestack.net/posts/javascript) approach of leveraging native JS Modules support 
in Browsers to avoid needing any npm dependencies or build tools.

## Install

To get both llms.py and its UI it's recommended to install from PyPI:

:::sh
pip install llms-py
:::

Start the UI and an OpenAI compatible API on port **8000**:

:::sh
llms --serve 8000
:::

To launch the UI at `http://localhost:8000` and an OpenAI Endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions`.

If no UI is needed, download just [llms.py](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms/blob/main/llms.py) 
for all other client & server features:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/llms/main/llms.py
chmod +x llms.py
mv llms.py ~/.local/bin/llms
```

## Simple and Flexible UI

This starts the Chat UI from where you can interact with any of your configured OpenAI-compatible Chat 
Providers - for a single unified interface for accessing both local and premium cloud LLMs from the same UI.

## Configuration

You can configure which OpenAI compatible providers and models you want to use by adding them to your 
[llms.json](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms/blob/main/llms.json) in `~/.llms/llms.json`

Whilst the [ui.json](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms/blob/main/ui.json) configuration for the UI is maintained 
in `~/.llms/ui.json` where you can configure your preferred system prompts and other defaults.

### Fast, Local and Private

OSS & Free, no sign ups, no ads, no tracking, etc. All data is stored locally in the browser's IndexedDB that can 
be exported and imported to transfer chat histories between different browsers.

A goal for **llms.py** is to limit itself to its single python **aiohttp** dependency for minimal risk of 
conflicts and friction within multiple Python Environments, e.g. `llms.py` is an easy drop-in inside a 
ComfyUI Custom Node since it requires no any additional dependencies.

### Import / Export

All data is stored locally in the browser's IndexedDB which as it is tied to the browser's origin, you'll be 
able to maintain multiple independent conversational databases by just running the server on a different port.

When needed you can backup and transfer your entire chat history between different browsers using the **Export** 
and **Import** features on the home page.

## Rich Markdown & Syntax Highlighting

To maximize readability there's full support for Markdown and Syntax highlighting for the most popular programming 
languages.

:::

To quickly and easily make use of AI Responses, **Copy Code** icons are readily available on hover of all messages
and code blocks.

## Rich, Multimodal Inputs

The Chat UI goes beyond just text and can take advantage of the multimodal capabilities of modern LLMs
with support for Image, Audio and File inputs.

### üñºÔ∏è 1. Image Inputs & Analysis

Images can be uploaded directly into your conversations with vision-capable models for comprehensive image analysis.

Visual AI Responses are highly dependent on the model used. This is a typical example of the visual analysis provided by the latest Gemini Flash of our [ServiceStack Logo](/img/logo.png):

### üé§ 2. Audio Input & Transcription

Likewise you can upload Audio files and have them transcribed and analyzed by multi-modal models with audio capabilities.

[![llms-audio.webp](/img/posts/llms-py-ui/llms-audio.webp)](/img/posts/llms-py-ui/llms-audio.webp)
:::

Example of processing audio input. Audio files can be uploaded with system and user prompts
to instruct the model to transcribe and summarize its content where its 
multi-modal capabilities are integrated right within the chat interface.

### üìé 3. File and PDF Attachments

In addition to images and audio, you can also upload documents, PDFs and other files to
capable models to extract insights, summarize content or analyze data.

**Document Processing Use Cases:**
- **PDF Analysis**: Upload PDF documents for content extraction and analysis
- **Data Extraction**: Extract specific information from structured documents
- **Document Summarization**: Get concise summaries of lengthy documents
- **Query Content**: Ask questions about specific content in documents
- **Batch Processing**: Upload multiple files for comparative analysis

Perfect for research, document review, data analysis and content extractions.

## Custom AI Chat Requests

Send Custom Chat Completion requests through the settings dialog, allowing Users to fine-tune 
their AI requests with advanced options including:

 - **Temperature** `(0-2)` for controlling response randomness 
 - **Max Completion Tokens** to limit response length
 - **Seed** values for deterministic sampling 
 - **Top P** `(0-1)` for nucleus sampling
 - **Frequency** & **Presence Penalty** `(-2.0 to 2.0)` for reducing repetition
 - **Stop** Sequences to control where the API stops generating
 - **Reasoning Effort** constraints for reasoning models
 - **Top Logprobs** `(0-20)` for token probability analysis
 - **Verbosity** settings

## Enable / Disable Providers

Dynamically manage which providers you want to enable and disable at runtime.
Providers are invoked in the order they're defined in `llms.json` that supports the requested model.
If a provider fails, it tries the next available provider.

By default Providers with Free tiers are enabled first, followed by local providers and then premium
cloud providers which can all be enabled or disabled in the UI:

## Search History

Quickly find past conversations with built-in search:

:::

## Smart Autocomplete for Models & System Prompts

Autocomplete components are used to quickly find and select the preferred model and system prompt.

Only models from enabled providers will appear in the drop down, which will be available immediately after
providers are enabled.
