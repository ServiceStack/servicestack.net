In [Part 1 of our GPT CoffeeShop in .NET](/posts/building-typechat-coffeeshop-modelling) we looked at how we could easily
implement a TypeChat's CoffeeShop Application Database and Management UI which was able to dynamically generate TypeChat's
[coffeeShopSchema.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeChat/blob/main/examples/coffeeShop/src/coffeeShopSchema.ts)
in .NET using:

 - [CoffeeShopPromptProvider.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop.ServiceInterface/CoffeeShopPromptProvider.cs):
To create the `ScriptContext` containing all data and functionality our [#Script](https://sharpscript.net) is executed with
 - [/coffeeshop/schema.ss](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/gpt/coffeeshop/schema.ss):
**#Script** Template that generates the TypeScript Schema

The result of which produces a functionally equivalent
[/coffeeshop/schema.ts](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/gpt/coffeeshop/schema.ts) powered
by the data in CoffeeShop's Database.

## CoffeeShop .NET App

The purpose of which is to implement a CoffeeShop Menu which can fulfil ordering any of the products along with any 
toppings, customizations and preparation options listed by the App's database and resulting TypeScript Schema.

<div class="py-8 max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6">
    <lite-youtube class="w-full mx-4 my-4" width="560" height="315" videoid="OtgrIdkvw-4" style="background-image: url('https://img.youtube.com/vi/OtgrIdkvw-4/maxresdefault.jpg')"></lite-youtube>
</div>

The resulting App implements a standard Web UI to navigate all categories and products offered in the CoffeeShop Menu,
that also supports an Audio Input letting customers order from the Menu using their **Voice** - which relies on Open AI's 
GPT services utilising Microsoft's [TypeChat](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeChat) schema prompt and node library
to convert a natural language order into a `Cart` order our App can understand, you can try at:

<h3 class="not-prose text-center pb-8">
    <a class="text-4xl text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="https://coffeeshop.netcore.io">https://coffeeshop.netcore.io</a>

   </span> 
</h3>


The Web UI adopts the same build-free [Simple, Modern JavaScript](/posts/javascript) approach used to create blazor-vue's [Client Admin UI](/posts/admin-uis),
to create the CoffeeShop's reactive frontend UI utilizing progressive Vue.mjs, which is maintained in the
[Index.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/Pages/Index.cshtml) Home page.

This post explains how we implemented this functionality in .NET along with the different providers you can use to
transcribe audio recordings, save uploaded files and use GPT to convert natural language to order item requests
we can add to our cart.

### Implementing Voice Command Customer Orders

Before we're able to enlist Chat GPT to do our bidding for us, we need to capture our Customer's CoffeeShop Order
Voice Recording and transcribe it to text.

We have a few options when it comes to real-time **Speech-to-Text** translation services you can choose from, including:

 - [Google Cloud Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/) - Starts from **$0.016** /minute or **$0.012** 
if you're ok with Google to use your recordings to improve their AI models
 - [Amazon Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/) - Starts from **$0.024** /minute
 - [Azure AI Speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/speech-to-text) - Starts from **$0.0167** /minute
 - [OpenAI Whisper API](https://openai.com/research/whisper) - Flat rate of **$0.006** /minute for using their online API
 - [OpenAI Whisper Local](https://github.com/openai/whisper) - Whisper is also available as an OSS project you can run yourself
if you prefer to manage your own servers and local Whisper install

## ServiceStack.AI Providers

As the AI landscape is actively changing we want our Apps to be able to easily switch to different Speech-to-text providers
so we're able to evaluate and use the best provider for each use-case.

To support this we're maintaining **FREE** implementation-agnostic abstractions for different AI and GPT Providers to enable 
AI features in .NET Apps under the new [ServiceStack.AI](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/tree/main/ServiceStack/src/ServiceStack.Interfaces/AI)
namespace in our dependency-free **ServiceStack.Interfaces** package.

Where the implementations for these abstractions are maintained across the following NuGet packages according to their
required dependencies:

- `ServiceStack.Aws` - AI & GPT Providers for Amazon Web Services
- `ServiceStack.Azure` - AI & GPT Providers for Microsoft Azure
- `ServiceStack.GoogleCloud` - AI & GPT Providers for Google Cloud
- `ServiceStack.AI` - AI & GPT Providers for OpenAI APIs and local Whisper and Node TypeChat installs

These free abstractions and implementations allow .NET project's to decouple their **Speech-to-text** or **ChatGPT**
requirements from any single implementation where they can be easily substituted.

You're welcome to submit feature requests for other providers you'd like to see at:

<h3 class="not-prose text-center pb-8">
    <a class="text-3xl text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="https://servicestack.net/ideas">https://servicestack.net/ideas</a>
</h3>

### ISpeechToText

The `ISpeechToText` interface abstracts Speech-to-text services behind a simple API:

```csharp
public interface ISpeechToText
{
    // Once only task to run out-of-band before using the SpeechToText provider
    Task InitAsync(List<string> phrases, CancellationToken token = default);
    
    // Transcribe the Audio at recordingPath and return a JSON API Result
    Task<TranscriptResult> TranscribeAsync(string request, CancellationToken token);
}
```

As of this of this writing CoffeeShop supports using 5 different Speech-to-text providers, defaulting to using
Open AI's Whisper API:

 - `GoogleCloudSpeechToText` - to use Google Cloud's [Speech-to-Text v2](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/v2/) API 
 - `AwsSpeechToText` - to use [Amazon Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/transcribe/) API
 - `AzureSpeechToText` - to use [Azure Speech to text](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/speech-to-text) API
 - `WhisperApiSpeechToText` - to use [OpenAI's Whisper](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio) API
 - `WhisperLocalSpeechToText` - to use local install of [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)

CoffeeShop can use any of these providers by configuring it in [appsettings.json](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/appsettings.json):

```json
{
  "SpeechProvider": "WhisperApiSpeechToText"
}
```

Where all available providers are configured in
[Configure.Speech.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/Configure.Speech.cs):

```csharp
var speechProvider = context.Configuration.GetValue<string>("SpeechProvider");
if (speechProvider == nameof(GoogleCloudSpeechToText))
{
    services.AddSingleton<ISpeechToText>(c => {
        var config = c.Resolve<AppConfig>();
        var gcp = c.Resolve<GoogleCloudConfig>();
        return new GoogleCloudSpeechToText(SpeechClient.Create(),
            gcp.ToSpeechToTextConfig(x => {
                x.PhraseSetId = config.CoffeeShop.PhraseSetId;
                x.RecognizerId = config.CoffeeShop.RecognizerId;
            })
        );
    });
}
else if (speechProvider == nameof(AwsSpeechToText))
{
    services.AddSingleton<ISpeechToText>(c => {
        var config = c.Resolve<AppConfig>();
        var aws = c.Resolve<AwsConfig>();
        return new AwsSpeechToText(new AmazonTranscribeServiceClient(
                aws.AccessKey, aws.SecretKey, aws.ToRegionEndpoint()),
            aws.ToSpeechToTextConfig(x => 
                x.VocabularyName = config.CoffeeShop.VocabularyName));
    });
}
else if (speechProvider == nameof(AzureSpeechToText))
{
    services.AddSingleton<ISpeechToText>(c => {
        var azure = c.Resolve<AzureConfig>();
        return new AzureSpeechToText(azure.ToSpeechConfig());
    });
}
else if (speechProvider == nameof(WhisperApiSpeechToText))
{
    services.AddSingleton<ISpeechToText, WhisperApiSpeechToText>();
}
else if (speechProvider == nameof(WhisperLocalSpeechToText))
{
    services.AddSingleton<ISpeechToText>(c => new WhisperLocalSpeechToText {
        WhisperPath = c.Resolve<AppConfig>().WhisperPath,
        TimeoutMs = c.Resolve<AppConfig>().NodeProcessTimeoutMs,
    });
}
```

### CoffeeShop OpenAI Defaults

To support a minimal infrastructure dependency solution the [CoffeeShop](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop) GitHub Repo 
is configured by default to use OpenAI's Whisper API to transcribe recordings that are persisted to local disk. 

Which at a minimum to use CoffeeShop's text or voice activated commands needs the `OPENAI_API_KEY` Environment Variable 
configured with your [OpenAI API Key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety).

Alternatively use `WhisperLocalSpeechToText` with a [local install of OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
available from your `$PATH` or `WhisperPath` configured in **appsettings.json**

### coffeeshop.netcore.io uses GoogleCloud

As we want to upload and store our Customer voice recordings in managed storage (and be able to later measure their effectiveness)
we decided to use **Google Cloud** since it offers the best value. 

It also offers the best latency when using managed storage as when configured to use [GoogleCloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage),
audio recordings only need to upload it once as they can be referenced directly by its Speech-to-text APIs.

To use any of the Google Cloud providers your pc needs to be configured with [GoogleCloud Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/before-you-begin) on a project 
with Speech-to-Text enabled.

## Virtual File System

By default CoffeeShop is configured to upload its recordings to the local file system, this can be changed to upload
to your preferred [Virtual File System](https://docs.servicestack.net/virtual-file-system) provider:

 - `FileSystemVirtualFiles` - stores uploads in local file system (default)
 - `GoogleCloudVirtualFiles` - stores uploads in Google Cloud Storage
 - `S3VirtualFiles` - stores uploads in AWS S3
 - `AzureBlobVirtualFiles` - stores uploads in Azure Blob Storage
 - `R2VirtualFiles` - stores uploads in Cloudflare R2

By configuring **VfsProvider** in **appsettings.json**, e.g:

```json
{
  "VfsProvider": "GoogleCloudVirtualFiles"
}
```

Which are configured in [Configure.Vfs.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/Configure.Vfs.cs):

```csharp
var vfsProvider = appHost.AppSettings.Get<string>("VfsProvider");
if (vfsProvider == nameof(GoogleCloudVirtualFiles))
{
    GoogleCloudConfig.AssertValidCredentials();
    appHost.VirtualFiles = new GoogleCloudVirtualFiles(
        StorageClient.Create(), appHost.Resolve<GoogleCloudConfig>().Bucket!);
}
else if (vfsProvider == nameof(S3VirtualFiles))
{
    var aws = appHost.Resolve<AwsConfig>();
    appHost.VirtualFiles = new S3VirtualFiles(new AmazonS3Client(
        aws.AccessKey,
        aws.SecretKey,
        aws.ToRegionEndpoint()), aws.Bucket);
}
else if (vfsProvider == nameof(R2VirtualFiles))
{
    var r2 = appHost.Resolve<CloudflareConfig>();
    appHost.VirtualFiles = new R2VirtualFiles(new AmazonS3Client(
        r2.AccessKey,
        r2.SecretKey,
        new AmazonS3Config {
            ServiceURL = r2.ToServiceUrl(),
        }), r2.Bucket);
}
else if (vfsProvider == nameof(AzureBlobVirtualFiles))
{
    var azure = appHost.Resolve<AzureConfig>();
    appHost.VirtualFiles = new AzureBlobVirtualFiles(
        azure.ConnectionString, azure.ContainerName);
}
```

### Managed File Uploads

The File Uploads themselves are managed by the [Managed File Uploads](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/files-upload-filesystem)
feature which uses the configuration below to only allows uploading **recordings**:

 - For known **Web Audio** File Types
 - Accepts uploads by **anyone**
 - A maximum size of **1MB**

Whose file upload location is derived from when it was uploaded:

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new FilesUploadFeature(
    new UploadLocation("recordings", VirtualFiles, allowExtensions:FileExt.WebAudios, writeAccessRole: RoleNames.AllowAnon,
        maxFileBytes: 1024 * 1024,
        transformFile: ctx => ConvertAudioToWebM(ctx.File),
        resolvePath: ctx => $"/recordings/{ctx.GetDto<IRequireFeature>().Feature}/{ctx.DateSegment}/{DateTime.UtcNow.TimeOfDay.TotalMilliseconds}.{ctx.FileExtension}")
));
```

## Transcribe Audio Recording API

This feature allows the `CreateRecording` [AutoQuery CRUD API](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery/crud) 
to declaratively support file uploads with the `[UploadTo("recordings")]` attribute: 

```csharp
public class CreateRecording : ICreateDb<Recording>, IReturn<Recording>
{
    [ValidateNotEmpty]
    public string Feature { get; set; }

    [Input(Type="file"), UploadTo("recordings")]
    public string Path { get; set; }
}
```

Where it will be uploaded to the `VirtualFiles` provider configured in the **recordings** file `UploadLocation`.

As we want the same API to also transcribe the recording, we've implemented a [Custom AutoQuery implementation](https://docs.servicestack.net/autoquery/crud#custom-autoquery-crud-implementation) in 
[GptServices.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop.ServiceInterface/GptServices.cs)
that after creating the `Recording` entry with a populated relative `Path` of where the Audio file was uploaded to, 
calls `ISpeechToText.TranscribeAsync()` to kick off the recording transcription request with the configured Speech-to-text provider. 

After it completes its JSON Response is then added to the `Recording` row and saved to the configured VirtualFiles provider before
being returned in the API Response:

```csharp
public class GptServices : Service
{
    //...
    public IAutoQueryDb AutoQuery { get; set; }
    public ISpeechToText SpeechToText { get; set; }
    
    public async Task<object> Any(CreateRecording request)
    {
        var feature = request.Feature.ToLower();
        var recording = (Recording)await AutoQuery.CreateAsync(request, Request);

        var transcribeStart = DateTime.UtcNow;
        await Db.UpdateOnlyAsync(() => new Recording { TranscribeStart = transcribeStart },
            where: x => x.Id == recording.Id);

        ResponseStatus? responseStatus = null;
        try
        {
            var response = await SpeechToText.TranscribeAsync(request.Path);
            var transcribeEnd = DateTime.UtcNow;
            await Db.UpdateOnlyAsync(() => new Recording
            {
                Feature = feature,
                Provider = SpeechToText.GetType().Name,
                Transcript = response.Transcript,
                TranscriptConfidence = response.Confidence,
                TranscriptResponse = response.ApiResponse,
                TranscribeEnd = transcribeEnd,
                TranscribeDurationMs = (int)(transcribeEnd - transcribeStart).TotalMilliseconds,
                Error = response.ResponseStatus.ToJson(),
            }, where: x => x.Id == recording.Id);
            responseStatus = response.ResponseStatus;
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            await Db.UpdateOnlyAsync(() => new Recording { Error = e.ToString() },
                where: x => x.Id == recording.Id);
            responseStatus = e.ToResponseStatus();
        }

        recording = await Db.SingleByIdAsync<Recording>(recording.Id);

        WriteJsonFile($"/speech-to-text/{feature}/{recording.CreatedDate:yyyy/MM/dd}/{recording.CreatedDate.TimeOfDay.TotalMilliseconds}.json", 
            recording.ToJson());

        if (responseStatus != null)
            throw new HttpError(responseStatus, HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);

        return recording;
    }
}
```

### Capturing and Uploading Web Audio Recordings

Now that our Server supports it we can start using this API to upload Audio Recordings. To simplify reuse we've 
encapsulated Web Audio API usage behind the [AudioRecorder.mjs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/wwwroot/mjs/AudioRecorder.mjs)
class whose `start()` method starts recording Audio from the Users microphone:

```js
import { AudioRecorder } from "/mjs/AudioRecorder.mjs"

let audioRecorder = new AudioRecorder()
await audioRecorder.start()
```

Where it captures audio chunks until `stop()` is called that are then stitched together into a `Blob` and converted into
a Blob DataURL that's returned within a populated [Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement)
Media element:

```js
const audio = await audioRecorder.stop()
```

That supports the [HTMLMediaElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement#instance_methods) API
allowing pause and playback of recordings:

```js
audio.play()
audio.pause()
```

The `AudioRecorder` also maintains the `Blob` of its latest recording in its `audioBlob` field and the **MimeType** that it was
captured with in `audioExt` field, which we can use to upload it to the `CreateRecording` API, which if 
successful will return a transcription of the Audio recording: 

```js
import { JsonApiClient } from "@servicestack/client"

const client = JsonApiClient.create()

const formData = new FormData()
formData.append('path', audioRecorder.audioBlob, `file.${audioRecorder.audioExt}`)
const api = await client.apiForm(new CreateRecording({feature:'coffeeshop'}),formData)
if (api.succeeded) {
   transcript.value = api.response.transcript
}
```

## TypeChat API

Now that we have a transcript of the Customers recording we need to enlist the services of Chat GPT to convert it into 
an Order request that our App can understand. 

### ITypeChat

Just as we've abstracted the Transcription Services our App binds to, we also want to abstract the TypeChat provider
our App uses so we can easily swap out and evaluate different solutions:

```csharp
public interface ITypeChat
{
    Task<TypeChatResponse> TranslateMessageAsync(TypeChatRequest request, 
        CancellationToken token = default);
}
```

Whilst a simple API on the surface, different execution and customizations options are available in the 
`TypeChatRequest` which at a minimum requires the **Schema** & **Prompt** to use and the **UserMessage** to convert:

```csharp
// Request to process a TypeChat Request
public class TypeChatRequest
{
    public TypeChatRequest(string schema, string prompt, string userMessage)
    {
        Schema = schema;
        Prompt = prompt;
        UserMessage = userMessage;
    }

    /// TypeScript Schema
    public string Schema { get; set; }
    
    /// TypeChat Prompt
    public string Prompt { get; set; }
    
    /// Chat Request
    public string UserMessage { get; }
    
    /// Path to node exe (default node in $PATH)
    public string? NodePath { get; set; }

    /// Timeout to wait for node script to complete (default 120s)
    public int NodeProcessTimeoutMs { get; set; } = 120 * 1000;

    /// Path to node TypeChat script (default typechat.mjs)
    public string? ScriptPath { get; set; }
    
    /// TypeChat Behavior we want to use (Json | Program)
    public TypeChatTranslator TypeChatTranslator { get; set; }

    /// Path to write TypeScript Schema to (default Temp File)
    public string? SchemaPath { get; set; }
    
    /// Which directory to execute the ScriptPath (default CurrentDirectory) 
    public string? WorkingDirectory { get; set; }
}
```

### IPromptProvider

Whilst App's can use whichever strategy they prefer to generate their TypeScript `Schema` and Chat GPT `Prompt` texts, 
they can still benefit from implementing the same `IPromptProvider` interface to improve code reuse which should contain 
the App-specific functionality for creating its **TypeScript Schema** and **GPT Prompt** from a `TypeChatRequest`, 
which CoffeeShop implements in 
[CoffeeShopPromptProvider.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop.ServiceInterface/CoffeeShopPromptProvider.cs):

```csharp
// The App Provider to use to generate TypeChat Schema and Prompts
public interface IPromptProvider
{
    // Create a TypeChat TypeScript Schema from a TypeChatRequest
    Task<string> CreateSchemaAsync(CancellationToken token);

    // Create a TypeChat TypeScript Prompt from a User request
    Task<string> CreatePromptAsync(string userMessage, CancellationToken token);
}
```

### Semantic Kernel TypeChat Provider

The natural approach for interfacing with OpenAI's ChatGPT API in .NET is to use [Microsoft's Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) 
to call it directly, that CoffeeShop can be configured with by specifying to use `KernelTypeChat` provider in **appsettings.json**:

```json
{
  "TypeChatProvider": "KernelTypeChat"
}
```

Which registers the `KernelTypeChat` in [Configure.Gpt.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/Configure.Gpt.cs)

```csharp
var kernel = Kernel.Builder.WithOpenAIChatCompletionService(
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_MODEL") ?? "gpt-3.5-turbo", 
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY")!)
    .Build();
services.AddSingleton(kernel);
services.AddSingleton<ITypeChat>(c => new KernelTypeChat(c.Resolve<IKernel>()));
```

## Using Chat GPT to process Natural Language Orders

We now have everything we need to start leveraging Chat GPT to convert our Customers **Natural Language** requests 
into Machine readable instructions that our App can understand, guided by TypeChat's TypeScript Schema.

The API to do this needs only a single property to capture the Customer request, that's either provided from a 
free-text text input or a Voice Input captured by Web Audio:  

```csharp
public class CreateChat : ICreateDb<Chat>, IReturn<Chat>
{
    [ValidateNotEmpty]
    public string Feature { get; set; }

    public string UserMessage { get; set; }
}
```

That just like `CreateRecording` is a custom AutoQuery CRUD Service that uses AutoQuery to create the 
initial `Chat` record, that's later updated with the GPT Chat API Response, executed from the configured
`ITypeChat` provider:

```csharp
public class GptServices : Service
{
    //...
    public IAutoQueryDb AutoQuery { get; set; }
    public IPromptProvider PromptProvider { get; set; }
    public ITypeChat TypeChatProvider { get; set; }
    
    public async Task<object> Any(CreateChat request)
    {
        var feature = request.Feature.ToLower();
        var promptProvider = PromptFactory.Get(feature);
        var chat = (Chat)await AutoQuery.CreateAsync(request, Request);

        var chatStart = DateTime.UtcNow;
        await Db.UpdateOnlyAsync(() => new Chat { ChatStart = chatStart },
            where: x => x.Id == chat.Id);

        ResponseStatus? responseStatus = null;
        try
        {
            var schema = await promptProvider.CreateSchemaAsync();
            var prompt = await promptProvider.CreatePromptAsync(request.UserMessage);
            var typeChatRequest = CreateTypeChatRequest(feature, schema, prompt, request.UserMessage);
            
            var response = await TypeChat.TranslateMessageAsync(typeChatRequest);
            var chatEnd = DateTime.UtcNow;
            await Db.UpdateOnlyAsync(() => new Chat
            {
                Request = request.UserMessage,
                Feature = feature,
                Provider = TypeChat.GetType().Name,
                Schema = schema,
                Prompt = prompt,
                ChatResponse = response.Result,
                ChatEnd = chatEnd,
                ChatDurationMs = (int)(chatEnd - chatStart).TotalMilliseconds,
                Error = response.ResponseStatus.ToJson(),
            }, where: x => x.Id == chat.Id);
            responseStatus = response.ResponseStatus;
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            await Db.UpdateOnlyAsync(() => new Chat { Error = e.ToString() },
                where: x => x.Id == chat.Id);
            responseStatus = e.ToResponseStatus();
        }

        chat = await Db.SingleByIdAsync<Chat>(chat.Id);
        
        WriteJsonFile($"/chat/{feature}/{chat.CreatedDate:yyyy/MM/dd}/{chat.CreatedDate.TimeOfDay.TotalMilliseconds}.json", chat.ToJson());

        if (responseStatus != null)
            throw new HttpError(responseStatus, HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
        
        return chat;
    }
}
```

The API then returns Chat GPTs JSON Response directly to the client:  

```js
apiChat.value = await client.api(new CreateChat({
    feature: 'coffeeshop',
    userMessage: request.toLowerCase()
}))

if (apiChat.value.response) {
    processChatItems(JSON.parse(apiChat.value.response.chatResponse).items)
} else if (apiChat.value.error) {
    apiProcessed.value = apiChat.value
}
```

That's in the structure of the TypeScript Schema's array of `Cart` LineItem's which are matched against the
products and available customizations from the App's database before being added to the user's cart in the 
[processChatItems(items)](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/Pages/Index.cshtml#L507) function.

### Trying it Out

Now that all the pieces are connected together, we can finally try it out! Hit the **Record** Icon to start the 
microphone recording to capture CoffeeShop Orders via Voice Input. 

Let's try a Natural Language Customer Order whose free-text input would be notoriously difficult to parse with traditional 
programming methods:  

> two tall lattes, the first one with no foam, the second one with whole milk. actually, make the first one a grande.

After the configured `ISpeechToText` provider has finished transcribing the uploaded Voice Recording it will display
the transcribed text whilst the request is being processed by Chat GPT:

:::

Then if all was successful we should see the Customer Order appear in the Customer's Cart, as if by magic!

:::

### Semantic Kernel Effectiveness

Most times you'll get the same desirable results when using Semantic Kernel to call Chat GPT from C# compared with
calling Chat GPT through node TypeChat as both are sending the same prompt to Chat GPT. 

Where they begin to differ is how they deal with invalid and undesirable responses from vague or problematic requests.

Lets take a look at an order from [TypeChat's input's](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeChat/blob/main/examples/coffeeShop/src/input.txt)
that Chat GPT had issues with: 

> i wanna latte macchiato with vanilla

That our Semantic Kernel Request translates into a reasonable Cart Item order:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "lineitem",
      "product": {
        "type": "LatteDrinks",
        "name": "latte macchiato",
        "options": [
          {
            "type": "Syrups",
            "name": "vanilla"
          }
        ]
      },
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

The problem being **"vanilla"** is close, but it's not an **exact match** for a **Syrup** on offer, so our order only gets partially filled:

:::{.shadow .rounded-sm}
[![](/img/posts/building-typechat-coffeeshop-modelling/coffeeshop-kernel-vanilla-latte-macchiato.png)](/img/posts/building-typechat-coffeeshop-modelling/coffeeshop-kernel-vanilla-latte-macchiato.png)
:::

### TypeChat's Invalid Response Handling

So how does TypeChat fair when handling the same problematic prompt?

:::{.shadow .rounded-sm}
[![](/img/posts/building-typechat-coffeeshop-modelling/typechat-failed-vanilla-latte-macchiato.png)](/img/posts/building-typechat-coffeeshop-modelling/typechat-failed-vanilla-latte-macchiato.png)
:::

It expectedly fails in the same way, but as it's able to validate JSON responses against the TypeScript's schema it 
knows and can report back where the failure occurs through the TypeScript's compiler schema validation errors.

### TypeChat's Auto Retry of Failed Requests

Interestingly before reporting back the schema validation error TypeChat had transparently sent a **retry** request back 
to Chat GPT with the original prompt with some additional context to help guide GPT into returning a valid response 
where it includes the invalid response it had received, an error message to say why it was invalid and the Schema
Validation Error:

```
//...
{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "lineitem",
      "product": {
        "type": "LatteDrinks",
        "name": "latte macchiato",
        "options": [
          {
            "type": "Syrups",
            "name": "vanilla"
          }
        ]
      },
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
The JSON object is invalid for the following reason:
"""
Type '"vanilla"' is not assignable to type '"butter" | "strawberry jam" | "cream cheese" | "regular" | "warmed" | "cut in half" | "whole milk" | "two percent milk" | "nonfat milk" | "coconut milk" | "soy milk" | "almond milk" | ... 42 more ... | "heavy cream"'.
"""
The following is a revised JSON object:
```

Unfortunately in this case the schema validation error is incomplete and doesn't include the valid values for
the `Syrups` type, so ChatGPT 3.5 never gets it right.

### Custom Validation with C# Semantic Kernel

The benefit of TypeScript Schema validation errors are that they require little effort since they're automatically 
generated by TypeScript's compiler. Since TypeChat isn't able to resolve the issue in this case, can we do better?

As we already need to perform our own validation to match GPT's `Cart` response back to our database products, we
can construct our own auto-correcting prompt by specifying what was wrong and repeating the definition of the failed
`Syrups` type, e.g:

``` 
//...
JSON validation failed: 'vanilla' is not a valid name for the type: Syrups

export interface Syrups {
    type: 'Syrups';
    name: 'almond syrup' | 'buttered rum syrup' | 'caramel syrup' | 'cinnamon syrup' | 'hazelnut syrup' | 
        'orange syrup' | 'peppermint syrup' | 'raspberry syrup' | 'toffee syrup' | 'vanilla syrup';
    optionQuantity?: OptionQuantity;
}
```

Lo and behold we get what we're after, an expected valid response with the correct **"vanilla syrup"** value: 

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "lineitem",
      "product": {
        "type": "LatteDrinks",
        "name": "latte macchiato",
        "options": [
          {
            "type": "Syrups",
            "name": "vanilla syrup"
          }
        ]
      },
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This goes to show that interfacing with ChatGPT in C# with Semantic Kernel is a viable solution that whilst requires
more bespoke logic and manual validation, can produce a more effective response than what's possible with TypeChat's schema
validation errors.

If you need to maintain few interfaces with ChatGPT, building your solution all in .NET might be the best option, but if
you need to generate and maintain multiple schemas then using a generic library with automated retries like TypeChat utilizing 
TypeScript Schema validation errors is likely preferred.

### TypeChat with ChatGPT 4

As we're not able to achieve a successful response from this problematic request from GPT-3.5, would ChatGPT 4 fair
any better?

Lets try by setting the `OPENAI_MODEL` Environment Variable to **gpt-4** in your shell:

:::sh
set OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
:::

Then retry the same request:

:::{.shadow .rounded-sm}
[![](/img/posts/building-typechat-coffeeshop-modelling/typechat-success-vanilla-latte-macchiato.png)](/img/posts/building-typechat-coffeeshop-modelling/typechat-success-vanilla-latte-macchiato.png)
:::

Success! GPT-4 didn't even need the retry and gets it right in one-shot on its first try.

So the easiest way to improve the success rate of your TypeChat GPT solutions is to switch to GPT-4, or for a more cost
effective approach you can start with GPT-3.5 than retry failed requests with GPT-4.

## Node TypeChat Provider

As TypeChat uses **typescript** we'll need to call out to the **node** executable in order to be able to use it from
our .NET App.

To configure our App to talk to ChatGPT API via TypeChat we need to specify to use `NodeTypeChat` provider in **appsettings.json**:

```json
{
  "TypeChatProvider": "NodeTypeChat"
}
```

Which will configure to use the `NodeTypeChat` in [Configure.Gpt.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/Configure.Gpt.cs)

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<ITypeChat>(c => new NodeTypeChat());
```

It works by executing an **external process** that invokes our custom
[typechat.mjs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/typechat.mjs) wrapper around TypeChat's
functionality to invoke it and return any error responses in a structured `ResponseStatus` format that our .NET App 
can understand, which you can also invoke manually from the command line with:

:::sh
node typechat.mjs json gpt\coffeeshop\schema.ts "i wanna latte macchiato with vanilla"
:::

Lets test this out this with an `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4` Environment Variable so we can see the above problematic prompt 
working in our App:

:::{.shadow .rounded-sm}
[![](/img/posts/building-typechat-coffeeshop-modelling/coffeeshop-nodegpt4-vanilla-latte-macchiato.png)](/img/posts/building-typechat-coffeeshop-modelling/coffeeshop-nodegpt4-vanilla-latte-macchiato.png)
:::

With everything connected and working together, try node's TypeChat out by ordering something from the CoffeeShop Menu or
try out some of TypeChat's [input.txt](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeChat/blob/main/examples/coffeeShop/src/input.txt) examples for inspiration.

## Try Alternative Providers

Feel free to try and evaluate different providers to measure how well each performs, if you prefer a managed cloud option 
switch to use GoogleCloud to store voice recordings and transcribe audio by configuring **appsettings.json** with:

```json
{
  "VfsProvider": "GoogleCloudVirtualFiles",
  "SpeechProvider": "GoogleCloudSpeechToText"
}
```

Using GoogleCloud Services requires your workstation to be configured with [GoogleCloud Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/before-you-begin).

A nice feature from using Cloud Services is the built-in tooling in IDEs like JetBrains 
[Big Data Tools](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12494-big-data-tools) where you can inspect new Recordings and ChatGPT
JSON responses from within your IDE, instead of SSH'ing into remote servers to inspect local volumes:

### Workaround for Safari

CoffeeShop worked great in all modern browsers we tested on in Windows including: Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Vivaldi but
unfortunately failed in Safari which seemed strange since we're using [WebM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebM):

> the open, royalty-free, media file format designed for the web!

So much for "open formats", guess we'll have to switch to the format that all browsers support.
This information isn't readily available so I used this little script to detect which popular formats are supported in each browser:  

```js
const containers = ['webm', 'ogg', 'mp4', 'x-matroska', '3gpp', '3gpp2', 
                    '3gp2', 'quicktime', 'mpeg', 'aac', 'flac', 'wav']
const codecs = ['vp9', 'vp8', 'avc1', 'av1', 'h265', 'h.265', 'h264',             
                'h.264', 'opus', 'pcm', 'aac', 'mpeg', 'mp4a'];

const supportedAudios = containers.map(format => `audio/${format}`)
  .filter(mimeType => MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported(mimeType))
const supportedAudioCodecs = supportedAudios.flatMap(audio => 
  codecs.map(codec => `${audio};codecs=${codec}`))
      .filter(mimeType => MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported(mimeType))

console.log('Supported Audio formats:', supportedAudios)
console.log('Supported Audio codecs:', supportedAudioCodecs)
```

### Windows

All Chrome and Blink-based browsers inc. Edge and Vivaldi reported the same results:

```
Supported Audio formats: ['audio/webm']
Supported Audio codecs: ['audio/webm;codecs=opus', 'audio/webm;codecs=pcm']
```

Whilst Firefox reported:

```
Supported Audio formats: ["audio/webm", "audio/ogg"]
Supported Audio codecs: ["audio/webm;codecs=opus", "audio/ogg;codecs=opus"]
```

Things aren't looking good, we have exactly one shared Audio Format and Codec supported by all modern browsers on Windows.

### macOS

What does Safari say it supports?

```
Supported Audio formats: ["audio/mp4"]
Supported Audio codecs: ["audio/mp4;codecs=avc1", "audio/mp4;codecs=mp4a"]
```

That's unfortunate, The only Audio format Safari supports isn't supported by any other browser, even worse it's not an audio
encoding that [Google Speech-to-text supports](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/encoding). 

This means if we want to be able to serve Customers with shiny iPhone's we're going to need to convert it into a format
that the Speech-to-text APIs accepts, the logical choice being to use the same format that we're capturing from other
browsers natively, i.e. `audio/webm`.

### ffmpeg

Our first attempt to do this in .NET with [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) failed on macOS since it relied
on Windows APIs to perform the conversion.

Luckily this is pretty easy to do with the amazingly versatile [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) - that can be installed on macOS with
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

:::sh
brew install ffmpeg
:::

Whilst CoffeeShop's Ubuntu 22.04 [Dockerfile](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/Dockerfile) it uses 
to deploy to Linux installs it with:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get clean && apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl gnupg ffmpeg
```

### Converting Uploaded Files

We now need to integrate this conversion into our workflow. As we're using 
[Managed Files Uploads](https://docs.servicestack.net/locode/files-overview) to handle our uploads, the best place to
add support for it is in `transformFile` where you can intercept the file upload and transform it to a more suitable
upload for your App to work with, by configuring the `UploadLocation` in 
[Configure.AppHost.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/Configure.AppHost.cs):

```csharp
Plugins.Add(new FilesUploadFeature(
    new UploadLocation("recordings", VirtualFiles, allowExtensions:FileExt.WebAudios, writeAccessRole: RoleNames.AllowAnon,
        maxFileBytes: 1024 * 1024,
        transformFile: ctx => ConvertAudioToWebM(ctx.File),
        resolvePath: ctx => $"/recordings/{ctx.DateSegment}/{DateTime.UtcNow.TimeOfDay.TotalMilliseconds}.{ctx.FileExtension}")
));
```

Where the `ConvertAudioToWebM` handles converting Safari's **.mp4** Audio recordings into **.webm** format by executing 
the external **ffmpeg** process, the converted file is then returned in a new `HttpFile` referencing the new **.webm** Stream contents:

```csharp
public async Task<IHttpFile?> ConvertAudioToWebM(IHttpFile file)
{
    if (!file.FileName.EndsWith("mp4")) 
        return file;
    
    var ffmpegPath = ProcessUtils.FindExePath("ffmpeg") 
        ?? throw new Exception("Could not resolve path to ffmpeg");
    
    var now = DateTime.UtcNow;
    var time = $"{now:yyyy-M-d_s.fff}";
    var tmpDir = Environment.CurrentDirectory.CombineWith("App_Data/tmp").AssertDir();
    var tmpMp4 = tmpDir.CombineWith($"{time}.mp4");
    await using (File.Create(tmpMp4)) {}
    var tmpWebm = tmpDir.CombineWith($"{time}.webm");
    
    var msMp4 = await file.InputStream.CopyToNewMemoryStreamAsync();
    await using (var fsMp4 = File.OpenWrite(tmpMp4))
    {
        await msMp4.WriteToAsync(fsMp4);
    }
    await ProcessUtils.RunShellAsync($"{ffmpegPath} -i {tmpMp4} {tmpWebm}");
    File.Delete(tmpMp4);
    
    HttpFile? to = null;
    await using (var fsWebm = File.OpenRead(tmpWebm))
    {
        to = new HttpFile(file) {
            FileName = file.FileName.WithoutExtension() + ".webm",
            InputStream = await fsWebm.CopyToNewMemoryStreamAsync()
        };
    }
    File.Delete(tmpWebm);

    return to;
}
```

In the terminal this simply done by specifying the **file.mp4** input file and the output file extension and format
you want it converted to:

:::sh
ffmpeg -i file.mp4 file.webm
:::

With this finishing touch CoffeeShop is now accepting Customer Orders from all modern browsers in all major Operating Systems at:

<h3 class="not-prose text-center pb-8">
    <a class="text-4xl text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="https://coffeeshop.netcore.io">https://coffeeshop.netcore.io</a>
</h3>

## Local OpenAI Whisper

CoffeeShop also serves as nice real-world example we can use to evaluate the effectiveness of different GPT models,
which has been surprisingly [effortless on Apple Silicon](https://servicestack.net/posts/postgres-mysql-sqlserver-on-apple-silicon) 
whose great specs and popularity amongst developers means a lot of the new GPT projects are well supported on my new M2 Macbook Air.

As we already have **ffmpeg** installed, installing [OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) can be done with:

:::sh
pip install -U openai-whisper
:::

Where you'll then be able to transcribe Audio recordings that's as easy as specifying the recording you want a transcription of:

:::sh
whisper recording.webm
:::

#### Usage Notes

 - The `--language` flag helps speed up transcriptions by avoiding needing to run auto language detection
 - By default whisper will generate its transcription results in all supported `.txt`, `.json`, `.tsv`, `.srt` and `.vtt` formats
   - you can limit to just the format you want it in with `--output_format`, e.g. use `txt` if you're just interested in the transcribed text
 - The default install also had [FP16](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/301) and 
[Numba Deprecation](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/1344) warnings

All these issues were resolved by using the modified prompt: 

```bash
export PYTHONWARNINGS="ignore"
whisper --language=en --fp16 False --output_format txt recording.webm
```

Which should now generate a clean output containing the recordings transcribed text, that's also written to `recording.txt`:

```
[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  A latte, please.
```

Which took **9 seconds** to transcribe on my M2 Macbook Air, a fair bit longer than the **1-2 seconds** it takes to upload
and transcribe recordings to Google Cloud, but still within acceptable response times for real-time transcriptions.  

### Switch to local OpenAI Whisper

You can evaluate how well local `whisper` performs for transcribing CoffeeShop recordings in **appsettings.json**: 

```json
{
  "SpeechProvider": "WhisperLocalSpeechToText"
}
```

Which configures [Configure.Speech.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CoffeeShop/blob/main/CoffeeShop/Configure.Speech.cs)
to use `WhisperLocalSpeechToText`:

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<ISpeechToText>(c => new WhisperLocalSpeechToText {
   WhisperPath = c.Resolve<AppConfig>().WhisperPath ?? ProcessUtils.FindExePath("whisper"),
   TimeoutMs = c.Resolve<AppConfig>().NodeProcessTimeoutMs,
});
```

## Running LLMs Locally

Being able to run [OpenAI's Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) locally gives our App the option for removing  
an external API and infrastructure dependency, will it also be possible to run LLM locally to remove our ChatGPT dependency?

Thanks to tools like [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) we're able to run popular Open Source LLMs 
from our laptops. An easy way to easily download and evaluate different LLMs is using the [llm](https://llm.datasette.io) 
Python utility that can be installed with:

:::sh
pip install llm
:::

That you can use to install the **llama.cpp** plugin with:

:::sh
llm install llm-llama-cpp
:::

Then use that it to download the popular Llama2 7B model with: 

```bash
llm llama-cpp download-model \
https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin \
--alias llama2-chat --alias l2c --llama2-chat
```

Which lets us ask our local LLama2 model what we want, a great list used to measure the effectiveness of 
different LLMs can be found at [benchmarks.llmonitor.com](https://benchmarks.llmonitor.com):

:::sh
llm -m l2c 'Argue for and against the use of kubernetes in the style of a haiku.' 
:::

Which our Llama2 took **64.51s** to responded with:

```
Sure, I can provide a haiku argument for and against the use of Kubernetes:

**For Kubernetes:**

Containerized world
Efficiently orchestrated bliss
Apps swim with ease

Kubernetes reigns
Managing pods with grace
Smooth sailing ahead

**Against Kubernetes:**

Overcomplicated sea
Cluttered with APIs and tools
Tainted by complexity

Kubernetes, alas
Forcing us to conform
To its rigid ways
```

The response is impressive, unfortunately taking over 1 minute to execute wasn't. 

Whilst we're here lets see how viable the Open Source models are for evaluating our natural language CoffeeShop orders,
which we can do with: 

```bash
curl --get --data-urlencode "userMessage=i'd like a latte that's it" \
https://coffeeshop.netcore.io/coffeeshop/prompt | llm -m l2c
```

:::info tip
Or use `https://localhost:5001/coffeeshop/prompt` to use a local App prompt
:::

Which we're happy to report returns a valid JSON prompt our App can process:

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "type": "lineitem",
            "product": {
                "type": "LatteDrinks",
                "name": "latte",
                "temperature": "hot",
                "size": "grande"
            },
            "quantity": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

Whilst Llama2 7B isn't nearly as capable or accurate as ChatGPT, it demonstrates potential for Open Source LLMs to
eventually become a viable option for being able to add support for natural language requests in our Apps.

Unfortunately the **105s** time it took to execute makes it unsuitable for handling any real-time tasks, when running on 
laptop hardware at least with only a **10-core GPU** and **24GB RAM** with **100GB/s** memory bandwidth. 

But the top-line specs of PC's equipped with high-end Nvidia GPUs or Apple Silicon's [Mac Studio](https://www.apple.com/au/mac-studio/) 
Ultra's impressive **76-core GPU** with **192GB RAM** at **800GB/s** memory bandwidth should mean we'll be able to run our 
AI workloads on consumer hardware in the not too distant future.

### Local AI Workflows

Whilst running all our App's AI requirements from a laptop may not be feasible just yet, we're still able to execute
some cool AI workflows that's only been possible to do from our laptop's until very recently.

For example, this shell command:

 - uses **ffmpeg** to capture 5 seconds of our voice recording 
 - uses **whisper** to transcribe our recording to text
 - uses CoffeeShop Prompt API to create a TypeChat Request from our text order
 - uses **llm** to execute our App's TypeChat prompt with our local Llama2 7B LLM

```bash
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i ":1" -t 5 order.mp3 \
&& whisper --language=en --fp16 False --output_format txt order.mp3 \
&& curl --get --data-urlencode "userMessage=$(cat order.txt)" \
https://coffeeshop.netcore.io/coffeeshop/prompt | llm -m l2c
```

If all stars have aligned you should get a machine readable JSON response the CoffeeShop can process to turn your 
voice recording into a Cart order:

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "type": "lineitem",
            "product": {
                "type": "LatteDrinks",
                "name": "latte",
                "temperature": "hot",
                "size": "grande"
            },
            "quantity": 1
        }
    ]
}
```
