We're excited to announce **ServiceStack v10** - a major release aligned with Microsoft's newly released .NET 10 LTS. This milestone release brings first-class .NET 10 support across the entire ServiceStack ecosystem, with all packages now shipping native .NET 10 builds optimized for the latest runtime.

As part of this major upgrade, we've modernized and streamlined our tooling:

- All project templates upgraded to .NET 10
- Adopted the new modern, simplified `.slnx` solution format
- Enhanced Kamal GitHub Action deployments

### New .NET 10 OpenAPI Packages
- **ServiceStack.OpenApi.Swashbuckle** with Swagger UI
- **ServiceStack.OpenApi.Microsoft** with Scalar UI
