Software development has reached an inflection point where rewriting complete application UIs now takes hours instead of months. With AI models excelling at code transformations, **your existing codebase becomes the perfect specification** - defining all features, workflows, edge cases, and business logic with zero ambiguity.

We've demonstrated this with [techstacks.io](https://techstacks.io), migrating **20 pages** and **23 components** from Nuxt.js/Vuetify to **Next.js 16/React 19/Tailwind v4** in just a couple of days (with the actual AI-assisted migration taking only hours). The previous manual migration took several weeks.

The real ROI isn't the one-time rewrite - it's the velocity gained afterward. On an AI-native stack, features like "Add dark mode" or "Implement infinite scrolling" become natural-language prompts instead of developer tickets. For many legacy frontends, **it's now cheaper to rewrite than to keep refactoring**.
