We're excited to announce [react-templates.net](https://react-templates.net) - a new collection of 5 React templates optimized for AI-assisted development with .NET 10. As AI Models become proficient enough to build features in minutes and rewrite UIs in hours, we've focused on the stack where AI excels: **React 19**, **Next.js 16**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS v4**.

The new templates feature a new **NodeProxy architecture** that eliminates the complexity of managing separate dev servers. Simply run `dotnet watch` to access your React App at `https://localhost:5001` with full HMR support:

- **react-static** and **next-static** - Minimal starting templates with static exports
- **react-spa** and **nextjs** - Full-featured templates with Blog, MDX, shadcn/ui
- **next-rsc** - Cutting-edge React Server Components with .NET API access

All templates seamlessly integrate .NET APIs, Razor Pages, and React UIs, integrates Identity Auth, and comes with comprehensive **AGENTS.md** files for optimal AI-assisted development. Start your next project at [react-templates.net](https://react-templates.net)
