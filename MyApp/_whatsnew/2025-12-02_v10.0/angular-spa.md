Introducing the new **Angular 21 SPA Template** - a modern, full-stack template combining Angular 21 with a powerful .NET 10 backend. Built with standalone components and no NgModules, it embraces Angular's latest architecture with support for both **RxJS Observables** and **Angular Signals** reactivity models.

The template features **Tailwind CSS v4** with dark mode support, **ASP.NET Core Identity** authentication with beautifully styled pages, and a streamlined development workflow where `dotnet watch` starts both the .NET backend and Angular dev server with Hot Module Replacement at a single `https://localhost:5001` endpoint.

The template includes comprehensive **AGENTS.md** documentation for optimal AI-assisted development, helping Claude and other AI assistants understand your project's ServiceStack conventions, Angular patterns and architecture.
