Comprehensive **Request Logging & Analytics** is now available for **PostgreSQL**, **SQL Server**, 
and **MySQL** with `DbRequestLogger` - a drop-in replacement unlocking deep, interactive API analytics 
previously limited to SQLite.

Get invaluable insights into API usage, performance monitoring, user behavior, troubleshooting, resource planning, 
and security with visual dashboards that make complex log data instantly understandable.

The analytics are fully interactive, allowing you to drill down from high-level dashboards into individual API 
endpoints, users, API keys, and IP addresses. Each view provides comprehensive metrics including request volumes, 
response times, HTTP status distributions, duration histograms, and direct links back to filtered request logs 
for rapid troubleshooting. Monitor your most-used APIs, identify performance bottlenecks, track user activity patterns, 
and spot unusual traffic - all from the Admin UI.
