AI Server continues to receive a steady stream of improvements during this release. 
This latest update introduces support for a wide range of new state-of-the-art LLM models, including 
**Google's gemini-pro-2.5**, **OpenAI's o1 and o3** models, **Meta's llama4**, and many more. 

We've also added custom rendering for **thinking responses**. 
Furthermore, AI Server now supports **Ollama Vision Models**, enabling the use of powerful open-source models like 
**gemma3:27b** and **mistral-small:24b** for image understanding. 

New **Ollama Endpoints** like `OllamaGeneration` and improvements to `ImageToText` have been implemented to 
leverage these vision capabilities. Upgrade now to experience these enhanced features for managing your AI integrations.
