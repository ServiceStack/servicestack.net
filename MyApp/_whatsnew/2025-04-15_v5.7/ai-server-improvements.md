AI Server continues to receive a steady stream of improvements during this release. 
This latest update introduces support for a wide range of new state-of-the-art LLM models, including 
**Google's gemini-pro-2.5**, **OpenAI's o1 and o3** models, **Meta's llama4**, and many more. 

AI Server's Management UI has been updated to include Comprehensive Analytics to provide deep and invaluable 
insight into your System API Usage, device distribution, API Keys and the IPs where most traffic generates.

We've also added custom rendering for **thinking responses**. Furthermore, AI Server now supports 
**Ollama Vision Models**, enabling the use of powerful open-source models like**gemma3:27b** and **mistral-small:24b** 
for image understanding. 

New **Ollama Endpoints** like `OllamaGeneration` and improvements to `ImageToText` have been implemented to 
leverage these vision capabilities. Upgrade now to experience these enhanced features for managing your AI integrations.
