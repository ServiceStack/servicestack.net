We're thrilled to announce the new **Angular 19** ASP.NET Core Tailwind SPA Template that's been rewritten 
from previous versions, moving from Angular 15 to Angular 19 to leverage the latest advancements in developer experience 
and performance.

This new template offers seamless integration with ASP.NET Core Identity Auth, providing ready-to-use features like 
registration, login, and user management. 

It utilizes **Tailwind v4 CSS** to enable rapid development of beautiful and responsive user interfaces that includes
built-in support for **Dark Mode**.

For data presentation, the template features a **customizable DataGrid component** and reusable **input components** 
with built-in **validation**. 

Notably, the template supports both **RxJS Observables and Angular Signals**, offering flexibility for modern Angular reactivity,
providing a productive starting point for building robust and feature-rich Angular applications.
