We're super excited to announce first-class support for [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org) and [Flutter](https://flutter.io)! - Google’s premier new mobile UI framework for crafting high-quality native interfaces for iOS and Android from a single code-base in record time with a Reactive development model simplifying the effort for building Complex UIs in similar vein to development models pioneered in popular JavaScript frameworks like React, React Native, Vue and Angular. It's offers a beautiful blend of rapid development cycles with its built-in Hot Reloading giving you instant iterative feedback of changes to your Mobile App in milliseconds, whilst still offering high-performance native experiences at runtime where Dart code is AOT compiled into native ARM in iOS and Android.
