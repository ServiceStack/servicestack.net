First-class React support optimized for AI-assisted development with new React Component Library & Project Templates. React and Tailwind have emerged as de facto standards for AI-generated UIs, with every major platform converging on this UI. ServiceStack's architecture is uniquely suited for AI development with declarative typed APIs, unambiguious integrations and end-to-end type safety—giving AI models full context they need to generate high-quality code.

Three production-ready templates are now available: 
- **react-vite** (lightweight foundation)
- **react-spa** (comprehensive SPA with ASP.NET Core Identity)
- **nextjs** (server-side rendering). 

All leverage the new [React Component Gallery](https://react.servicestack.net)—a high-fidelity port of our proven Vue and Blazor libraries, providing everything needed to build modern, responsive web applications with minimal code.
