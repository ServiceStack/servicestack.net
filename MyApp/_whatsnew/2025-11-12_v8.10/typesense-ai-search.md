We've launched a powerful new AI Search feature powered by Typesense's Conversational Search API, bringing intelligent, context-aware answers directly from ServiceStack Docs. Using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **Gemini Flash 2.5**, AI Search excels at answering complex `"how do I..."` questions by synthesizing information across multiple documentation pages.

The conversational interface allows you to ask natural language questions and receive AI-generated answers grounded in actual documentation, complete with relevant links and snippets. Multi-turn conversations maintain context, letting you ask follow-up questions. While traditional Typesense search remains ideal for finding specific pages, AI Search shines when you need explanations, understanding concepts, or help connecting different features together. 

Perfect for onboarding new developers, troubleshooting, and discovering ServiceStack features. Try it at [docs.servicestack.net](https://docs.servicestack.net) by clicking the **chat icon**.
