Database Admin UI lets Admin Users quickly browse and navigate your App's configured RDBMS schemas and tables,
with support for browsing, querying, ordering and filtering data directly from your database without needing to create any APIs 

Configuration is imported from your AppHost which can be easily added in shared development or testing environments 
for developers and non-developers alike to troubleshoot data issues
