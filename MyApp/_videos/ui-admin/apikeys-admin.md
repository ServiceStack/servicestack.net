Building on our experience with API Keys in previous versions of ServiceStack, we've taken the opportunity to redesign
how API Keys work to provide a more flexible and powerful way to manage access control for your APIs which includes
customizable built-in Admin UIs to manage both machine-to-machine API Keys and User API Keys, in addition all Identity Auth
Tailwind Templates includes a Identity User UIs for Users to create their own API Keys.
