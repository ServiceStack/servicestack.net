In this episode, we introduce our **new full-stack Single Page Application (SPA) template** built for high-performance web development. 

We explore how this modern foundation combines the latest frontend features of **Angular 21**—including Signals and Standalone Components—with a robust **.NET 10 backend** powered by ServiceStack v10, delivering high-performance APIs and **AutoQuery CRUD** out of the box. 

We walk through the developer experience improvements, from integrated **ASP.NET Core Identity Authentication** to utility-first styling with **Tailwind CSS 4** and dark mode support, plus a unified development workflow featuring Hot Module Replacement (HMR). 

We also discuss how the included AGENTS.md documentation enables seamless **AI-assisted development** by providing project context to tools like Claude. Finally, we cover the **deployment-ready** setup with automated workflows for containerization and one-command Kamal deployment.
