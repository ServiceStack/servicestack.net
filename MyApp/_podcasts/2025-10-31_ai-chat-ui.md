This episode details the features and implementation of **AI Chat**, a customizable, private, ChatGPT-like user 
interface built on **ServiceStack.AI.Chat** for .NET 8+ projects. A core value proposition is enabling 
organizations to offer a controlled AI experience while maintaining **Fast, Local, and Private** access, 
managing their own API keys and billing. 

Users can interact with the AI through a **Simple and Flexible UI** that supports **Rich, Multimodal Inputs** 
including image, audio, and file attachments, going beyond simple text conversations. 

Access is secured using **Identity Auth or Valid API Key** mechanisms, and the interface offers advanced 
customization for appearance, default system prompts, and **Custom AI Chat Requests** for fine-tuning model 
parameters. AI Chat also includes comprehensive features like a **Comprehensive System Prompt Library**, 
**Search History**, and tools for **Admin Users** to manage and prioritize different AI providers.
