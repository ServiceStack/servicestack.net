This episode covers ServiceStack v8.9, highlighting significant updates and new features that
improve performance, flexibility, and developer experience within the ServiceStack ecosystem.

Primarily centered around database interaction and AI capabilities. Significant updates to OrmLite 
including a new fluent configuration model, the adoption of JSON serialization for complex types, 
and new dialect defaults for providers like PostgreSQL and SQL Server. 

Furthermore, the release introduces an Async Tasks Builder for effortlessly executing parallel 
database requests and ports the durable Background Jobs and detailed RDBMS Request Logging and Analytics features 
to PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and MySQL, complete with native table partitioning support. 

Finally, the update unveils AI Chat, an OpenAI-compatible API and private, customizable ChatGPT-like UI, 
built around the core Chat Completion DTO for simplicity and portability, along with enhancements to 
API security by allowing the same APIs to be protected by both Identity Auth and API Keys.
