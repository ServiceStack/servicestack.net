This episode covers the new ASP.NET IdentityAuth Roles and Claims Management APIs and Admin UIs.
This new interface empowers administrators to manage user and role claims, as well as add and remove roles directly. 
Role claims are automatically inherited by users belonging to that role, streamlining permissions management. 
The updated UI for individual users also allows for the assignment of specific claims. 
Furthermore, the system enables the validation of these claims to control API access and supports customized 
error messages for claim validation failures. 
Developers can also inspect a user's claims programmatically within their services.
