This release also features a new Angular 19 SPA template with built-in authentication, Tailwind CSS, and support for 
RxJS and Signals, providing a modern foundation for web development. Furthermore, AI Server capabilities are expanded 
with support for more LLM models, including vision models via Ollama, and enhanced response handling. 

Finally, the update includes a cache-aware JsonApiClient, OrmLite and EF integration improvements, and a
