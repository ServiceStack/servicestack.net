ServiceStack version 8.7 introduces comprehensive and interactive API analytics accessible through the Admin UI for 
applications using SQLite request logging. 

This feature offers insights into API usage, performance, user behavior (including devices and bots), and potential 
security concerns. 

The analytics dashboard provides visualizations like pie charts and line charts to summarize API traffic, performance metrics, 
and user distribution. 

Users can drill down for detailed views of individual APIs, users, API keys, and IP addresses, with links back to 
raw request logs for troubleshooting. These analytics are now integrated into ASP.NET Core IdentityAuth templates, 
providing a valuable tool for monitoring and understanding application usage.
