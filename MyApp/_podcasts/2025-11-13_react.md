This episode introduces **ServiceStack's first-class React support**, optimized for **AI-assisted development** and the emerging "Vibe Coding" paradigm where developers guide AI to generate **React and Tailwind UIs**—now the de facto standards for modern web development.

**ServiceStack's architecture** provides the foundation for effective AI code generation through declarative typed APIs and end-to-end type safety, delivering the crucial context AI models require to produce high-quality code.

The episode showcases **new React project templates** and a comprehensive **component library** designed to accelerate modern web application development, while demonstrating how **TypeScript Data Models** can generate C# AutoQuery APIs and database migrations—complete with practical examples of AI-generated application features.
