In this episode, we dive into ServiceStack v10 - a major platform update that aligns with the newly released .NET 10 LTS. We'll explore how project templates have been upgraded, minimum supported versions raised, and the package structure streamlined by retiring legacy libraries. 

You'll hear about the modernized development workflow, where the older x dotnet tool gives way to simple, universally accessible npx scripts, along with comprehensive support for the new .NET 10 OpenAPI standard through two dedicated packages. 

But the real headline here is the shift to an AI-first development model known as "Vibe Coding." We discuss why AI works best with the Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind stack, and how new tooling like NodeProxy enables the seamless fusion of .NET APIs with modern React UIs—drastically simplifying the required development setup. 

We wrap up by showcasing how AI tools are making the rewriting of legacy UIs economically viable, with a complex application interface migration accomplished in days rather than months. This commitment to AI-native development represents a fundamental shift that supercharges developer productivity and iteration velocity.
