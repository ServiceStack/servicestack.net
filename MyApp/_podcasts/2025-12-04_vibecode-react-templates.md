In this episode, we dive into the new **Vibe Codable .NET React Templates** and explore the strategic shift in framework focus driven by the realization that current **AI Models are most proficient** in the React, Next.js, and TypeScript ecosystem. We walk through the **NodeProxy** architecture that allows .NET applications to handle all requests while proxying unknown routes to the Node server, creating a unified development experience accessible through a single `dotnet run` command. 

We discuss how this approach enables a **seamless fusion of .NET APIs and React UIs** and supports gradual modernization strategies for existing ASP.NET websites. We also cover the range of template options available, from minimal static exports like **react-static** to cutting-edge performance-focused options such as **Next.js RSC** (React Server Components), along with full-featured templates that include AI Chat functionality and API key management. Finally, we touch on how all deployments are configured for simplified, cost-effective hosting using **Kamal Deployments** and Docker.
