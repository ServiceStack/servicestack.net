In this episode, we explore a major inflection point in software development: modern AI tools have made it faster and cheaper to **rewrite legacy user interfaces (UIs)** than to keep patching and refactoring them. We look at how years of workarounds, outdated patterns, and accumulated **technical debt** make many legacy UIs better candidates for full replacement—especially when you take an **AI-first** approach to rebuilding them.

You’ll hear about a development style the author calls **“Vibe Coding”**—using your existing application as a **perfect blueprint** that AI models can follow to recreate your UI in a modern framework. Instead of starting from scratch, AI agents read and interpret your current codebase, then help translate it into technologies like **Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4** with surprising accuracy.

We also dive into a **real-world case study**: migrating the TechStacks UI from a Nuxt/Vuetify stack to a more **AI-friendly stack**, in a fraction of the time and cost of a previous migration. The episode closes by focusing on the biggest long-term payoff: once your app is on a clean, modern foundation, your **post-migration velocity** skyrockets—future features and UI changes can be implemented rapidly through **natural-language prompts** to AI agents, fundamentally changing how teams ship software.
