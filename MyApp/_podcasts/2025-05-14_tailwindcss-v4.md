This episode announces that all **ServiceStack ASP .NET Core Identity Auth Tailwind Templates** have 
been updated to use **Tailwind CSS v4.0**, highlighting its improved performance and flexibility.  

It explains a key change: non-Node.js templates now utilize the **Standalone CLI** for Tailwind v4 
since the previous `npx` method is no longer viable. The article details which specific 
**Blazor, Razor Pages, MVC, React, Vue, and Angular templates** have been upgraded, including 
both standard and statically generated versions.  

It also mentions the integration of the **Vite 6 plugin** for SPA templates and the availability of 
**universal markdown features** across different technology stacks using the Vite Press Plugin.
