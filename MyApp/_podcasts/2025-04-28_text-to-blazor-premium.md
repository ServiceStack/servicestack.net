This episode looks at the latest version of **Text to Blazor** that has been upgraded to utilize top-tier AI coding models from various leading companies to generate CRUD applications. 

This tool allows users to input a text description and receive five different sets of data models, APIs, database migrations, and admin UIs, enabling them to select the best fit. 

Unlike some AI tools, it primarily focuses on generating TypeScript data models, which are then used within existing Blazor templates to create functional admin or public-facing applications with automatically generated CRUD functionalities and optional audit logging. 

Over one hundred Blazor CRUD applications have already been created using this enhanced system. The generated applications include features like instant admin UIs, database migration scripts, and the ability to create new records directly from search dialogs.
